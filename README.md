# PyBer Analysis
## Overview of PyBer Analysis
I performed an analysis for V. Isualize, CEO of ride-sharing app PyBer, examining the fare and driver data from January to early May of 2019 based on different city types.
The goal of the analysis was to create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type using a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. This graph was used to summarize how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.

## Results
### Summary Data Frame
It is shown in the data frame there is a correlation between city size and average fares. The smallest, rural cities have the highest average fares per ride and driver. The total ride count and total drivers are also lowest in the rural cities. As the cities get larger, the amount of riders and drivers rise, making the average fare per ride and driver decrease. Through this data, we can see the accessibility of PyBer drivers and riders effects how much each ride costs.

### Summary of Total Fare by City Type
The above data frame was converted into a graph examining the fares from January to May by city type. This data was further analyzed to discover trends in the data. All three city types follow a patteren of fluctiation of fares each month. Each city sees a spike in total fares in the latter half of February, followed by a drop in fares toward the beginning of March. The trend of suburban fares see a dramatic spike in the month of April that is not reflected in the other city types.

## Three Business Recommendations to CEO of PyBer
  - PyBer could increase their footprint in rural cities by encouraging more drivers for the company in rural cities. Because there are fewer drivers in the smaller cities, the fares are higher, which could be turning away potential customers.
  - The increase in fares in the month of April for suburban cities could use a further analysis. We could work with V. Isualize to research what is causing this increase while the other cities were seeing a decrease. This could help the company pivot their focus in rural and urban cities to maximize profits in March. 
  - Due to each city seeing a drop in fares toward the beginning of March, PyBer could launch an advertising campaign in all city types to increase the riders and fares in each city. This could really boost the business and profits, potentially seeing higher results when the months after May are analyzed.
